The particle filter is a highly flexible filter, used to perform Bayesian inference for non-linear and non-Gaussian state space models. It works by simulating many realisations of the state space in a particle cloud and determining which are the closest fit to observed data by calculating the observation likelihood. This type of simulation can be slow. The [Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) is an exact solution for calculating the latent state for Gaussian, Dynamic Linear Models. The Kalman Filter is very efficient and accurate as it doesn't require simulation, but the class of models we consider can't be solved analytically in closed form. Other filters, such as the Extended and Unscented Kalman Filter have been developed, which apply to non-linear state space models. 

In our application, it is natural to use a particle filter. The particle filter can operate with observations arriving irregularly, it can handle non-Gaussian observation models and non-linear transformations.

## Introduction to the Bootstrap Particle Filter

Note, in this section we motivate and describe a simple application of the bootstrap particle filter to a Partially Observed Markov Process model. If you are already familiar with the bootstrap filter and would like to apply it using the API then please skip this section.

The bootstrap particle filter (\cite{Gordon1993}) is a simple filter able to estimate the state space of a POMP model. The latent state is governed by a transition kernel which we assume realisations can be simulated from, $\textbf{X}(t_i) \sim p(\textbf{x}(t_i)|\textbf{x}(t_{i-1}))$. The process is observed through an observation model $Y(t_i) \sim \pi(y(t_i) | \eta(t_i))$.

The bootstrap particle filter is used to calculate the unobserved system state by approximating the filtering distribution, $p(\textbf{x}(t_i)| y(t_{0:i}))$. The algorithm to determine an empirical approximation of the unobserved system state at each observation time is presented below:

1. Initialise: Simulate $N$ particles from the initial distribution of the state space, $\textbf{x}(t_0)^{(k)} \sim p(\textbf{x}(t_0))$, and set $i = 1$
2. Advance the state particle-cloud until the time of the next observation, $\textbf{x}(t_i)^{(k)} \sim p(\textbf{x}(t_i)^{(k)}|\textbf{x}(t_{i-1})^{(k)})$
3. Transform the each particle appropriately for the given observation model, $\eta(t_i)^{(k)} = g(F^T_{t_i} \textbf{x}(t_i)^{(k)})$
4. Calculate the weight of each particle, by calculating the likelihood of the observation given each particle: $w^*(t_i)^{(k)} = \pi(y(t_i)|\eta(t_i)^{(k)})$
5. Normalise the weights, $w(t_i)^{(k)} = \frac{w^*(t_i)^{(k)}}{\sum_{j=1}^N w^*(t_i)^j}$, the particles and associated normalised weights forms a weighted sample from the filtering distribution $p(\textbf{x}(t_i)| y(t_{1:i}))$, $\{\textbf{x}(t_i)^{(k)}, w(t_i)^{(k)} | k = 1,\dots,N \}$
6. Resample the state, by sampling with replacement $N$ times from a Multinomial distribution with each category representing a particle and the probability of choosing a particle represented by the associated weights, $w(t_i)^{(k)}$. This gives an approximate random sample from $p(\textbf{x}(t_i)| y(t_{0:i}))$
7. If $i = M$ return the random samples from the filtering distribution $p(\textbf{x}(t_i)| y(t_{0:i}))$ at all time points, else set $i = i + 1$ and go to 2

A simple illustrative particle filter can be implemented in Scala as follows:

```scala
trait ParticleFilter {
    import math.{exp, log}
    import ParticleFilter._

    val resample: (Vector[State], Vector[LogLikelihood]) => Vector[State]
    val stepFunction: (State, TimeInterval) => State
    val dataLikelihood: (State, Observation) => LogLikelihood
    val mean: Vector[LogLikelihood] => LogLikelihood = w => w.sum/w.length

    def filterStep(s: FilterState, y: Data): FilterState = {
        val dt = y.time - s.t0
  
        val x = resample(s.particles, s.weights)

        val x1 = s.particles map (stepFunction(_, dt))
        val w = x1 map (dataLikelihood(_, y.observation))

        val ll = s.ll + log(mean(w map exp))
 
        FilterState(x1, w, y.time, ll)
    }
}

object ParticleFilter {
    type Time = Double
    type Observation = Int
    type LogLikelihood = Double
    type State = Double
    type TimeInterval = Double

    case class FilterState(
        particles: Vector[State], 
        weights: Vector[LogLikelihood], 
        t0: Time, 
        ll: LogLikelihood)
    
    case class Data(time: Time, observation: Observation)
}
```

This abstract trait we have defined above is a simple shell for a particle filter. In order to implement a concrete class representing a bootstrap filter for a specific model, let's consider a simple model with a one-dimensional state-space and a Poisson observation model:

$$
\begin{align*}
N(t) &\sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda(t)) \\
\lambda(t)|x(t) &= \exp\{x(t)\} \\
\textrm{d}X(t) &= \mu + \sigma \textrm{d}W(t)
\end{align*}
$$

This Poisson model's latent state evolves according to generalised Brownian motion and the linking function, $g$, is the exponential function, since the rate of a poisson distribution, $\lambda(t)$ is always positive. Now we must implement the functions declared in the trait `ParticleFilter`.

* The parameters of the model can be written as a case class, `m0` and `c0` represent the parameters of the initial distribution of the state, represented by a draw from a Gaussian distribution. `mu` and `sigma` are the parameters of the Markov transition kernel, which is generalised Brownian motion

```scala
case class Parameters(m0: Double, c0: Double, mu: Double, sigma: Double)
```

* Advance the state according to generalised Brownian Motion

```scala
import breeze.stats.distributions.Gaussian

def stepBrownian(p: Parameters): (TimeInterval, State) => State = {
    (x, dt) => Gaussian(x + p.mu * dt, math.sqrt(p.sigma * p.sigma * dt)).draw
}
```

* Calculate the weights of each particle given the observation

```scala
import breeze.stats.distributions.Poisson

def poissonLikelihood: (State, Observation) => LogLikelihood = {
  (x, y) => Poisson(exp(x)).logProbabilityOf(y)
}
```

* Resample the states according to the likelihood weights, using Multinomial resampling

```scala
import breeze.stats.distributions.Multinomial
import breeze.linalg.DenseVector

def multinomialResample(x: Vector[State], w: Vector[LogLikelihood]): Vector[State] = {
  val xInd = Multinomial(DenseVector(w.toArray)).sample(x.length).toVector
  xInd map ( x(_) )
}
```

* Now, put all the pieces together in a case class extending the `ParticleFilter` trait:

```scala

case class PoissonPf(p: Parameters) extends ParticleFilter {
  val stepFunction: (State, TimeIncrement) => State = stepBrownian(p)
  val dataLikelihood: (State, Observation) => LogLikelihood = poissonLikelihood(p)
  val resample: (Vector[State], Vector[LogLikelihood]) => Vector[State] = multinomialResample _
}

```

In order to use the particle filter on a collection of data, we must first initialise a particle cloud of size `n` using the initial parameters and sampling `n` times from a Gaussian distribution:

```scala
val p = Parameters(0.1, 3.0, 0.1, 1.0)
val particles = Gaussian(p.m0, p.c0).sample(n)
```

Now, `filterStep` can be used on a `Stream` or `List` of data using `scanLeft`, the initial state of the particle filter is populated with `particles` and a vector of weights each equal to 1/n:

```scala
val data: Stream[Data] = \\ A stream of data
val pf = PoissonPf(p)
val init = FilterState(particles, Vector.fill(n)(1.0/n), ll = 0.0, t0 = 0.0)

data.scanLeft(init)(pf.filterStep)
```

The marginal likelihood of the path given the observed data and parameters can be approximated by calculating the product of the average of the weights at each time point. This pseudo-marginal likelihood is used in the [[Particle Marginal Metroplis Hastings|Streaming-MCMC]] algorithm, which can be used to calculate the full joint posterior $p(x, \theta | y)$. `filterStep` will calculate this, in conjunction with `scanLeft`, however, `scanLeft` emits each successive iteration. If the goal is to simply approximate the log-likelihood of a path, a simpler solution is to use `foldLeft`:

```scala
data.foldLeft(init)(pf.filterStep).ll
```

## Filtering a Stream of Data

In order to filter information arriving in real-time, given we have access to the marginal posterior distribution of the parameters given the data so far, we simply apply the particle filter to each new observation arriving. However, the particle filter relies on the previous value of the particle cloud and the time difference between each observation since our models allow the possibility of irregularly observed data.

This means we need to store state in the stream, let's first consider how to construct a stream of simulated data. We can use `Source.unfold` from [Akka streaming](https://akka.io) which allows us to construct infinite streams, as long as the function returns a `Some`. The function starts with a zero value, then passes the first value of the tuple inside the `Some` back into the function. In this way we can easily construct Markov chains as streams.

```scala
val mod: Model = // a parameterised model
val dt = 0.1 // the time step for the simulation
val d0 = simStep(mod.x0.draw, 0.0, dt, mod)

val sims = Source.unfold(d0)(x => Some((simStep(x.sdeState, x.t + dt, dt, mod), x))) 
```

Now we can simulate values from any model as a stream. Now we must apply a particle filter to the stream, assuming we don't know the values of the latent variables, which of course we do because the data is simulated. In order to keep track of state, we can use a `scan`.

```scala
val n = 1000
val t0 = 0.0
val particleCloud = Vector.fill(n)(mod.x0.draw)
val initState = Vector(PfState(t0, None, particleCloud, State.zero, IndexedSeq[CredibleInterval]()))

observations.
  scan(initState)((d, y) => filterStep(y, d, mod, 200))
```

`scan` accepts a zero value, `initState` and a function from a single observation, `y` and the previous state `d` to calculate the state given the current observation. Using `scan` in this way, outputs the value of the state as each observation is received.

## Example: Filtering a Single Model

Here we present an example of filtering a model with a Poisson observation model. First we simulate a Poisson model with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck state space.

```scala
import model.{LeafParameter, GaussianParameter, OrnsteinParameter}
import model.SimData._
import model.POMP.PoissonModel
import model.StateSpace._

val p = LeafParameter(
  GaussianParameter(-2.0, 1.0),
  None,
  OrnsteinParameter(theta = 2.0, alpha = 1.0, sigma = 1.0))
val mod = PoissonModel(stepOrnstein)


val times = (1.0 to 100.0 by 1.0).toList
val sims = simData(times, mod(p))
```

The figure below shows a simulation from the Poisson model, the state space of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process can vary on the entire real line, the parameter space of the Poisson model is $\mathbb{Z}^+$ as the parameter, $\lambda(t)$, is the mean of a counting process. The log-link function is used to transform the state space to the appropriate parameter space, $\lambda(t) = g(x(t)) = \exp(x(t))$

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
system("sbt \"run-main examples.SimulatePoisson\"")
poisson = read_csv("PoissonSims.csv", 
                col_names = c("Time", "Value", "Eta", "Gamma", "State"))

p1 = poisson %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Value)) + geom_step() + 
  ggtitle("Poisson Observations")

p2 = poisson %>%
  dplyr::select(Time, Eta, State) %>%
  gather(key = "key", value = "value", -Time) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = value, colour = key)) + geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~key, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") + theme(legend.position="none")

grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

Now we can use the particle filter to estimate the state space, the scala code is given here and is available in the examples in the Github repo.

```scala
  val data = // poisson data

  val p = LeafParameter(
    GaussianParameter(6.0, 1.0),
    None,
    OrnsteinParameter(theta = 6.0, alpha = 0.05, sigma = 1.0))

  // declare a new filter type including the model, resampling scheme and starting time, t0
  val filter = Filter(mod.model, ParticleFilter.multinomialResampling, t0 = 0.0)
  
  // use the filter to return the state and credible intervals with 1000 particles
  filter.filterWithIntervals(data)(1000)(mod.p)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
system("sbt \"run-main examples.FilterPoisson\"")
poissonFiltered = read_csv("PoissonFiltered.csv",
                        col_names = c("Time", "Value", "PredEta", "lowerEta", "upperEta", "PredState", "Lower", "Upper"))

p1 = poisson %>%
  dplyr::select(-Gamma, -Eta, -Value) %>%
  inner_join(poissonFiltered[,-2], by = "Time") %>%
  select(Time, State, PredState, Lower, Upper) %>%
  gather(key = "key", value = "value", -Time, -Lower, -Upper) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = Time, y = value, linetype = key)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = Time, ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), alpha = 0.3)

p2 = poisson %>%
  dplyr::select(-Gamma, -State, -Value) %>%
  inner_join(poissonFiltered[,-2], by = "Time") %>%
  select(Time, Eta, PredEta, lowerEta, upperEta) %>%
  gather(key = "key", value = "value", -Time, -lowerEta, -upperEta) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = Time, y = value, linetype = key)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = Time, ymin = lowerEta, ymax = upperEta), alpha = 0.3)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 1)
```
